Build config
------------
The default build config is resolved by qmake. To build LibIrcClient-Qt
specifically in release or debug mode, you may pass additional
"-config release" or "-config debug" parameters to qmake, respectively.
Furthermore, in order to build a static version of LibIrcClient-Qt, you
may pass "-config static".

ICU support
-----------
ICU support is enabled by default. If you do not have ICU installed or if you
want to disable the ICU support for other reasons, you may pass additional
"-config no_icu" parameters to qmake.

Deprecations
------------
Deprecated functionality is enabled by default. If you do not need
deprecated backwards compatible functionality (introduces small
overhead), you may pass additional "-config no_deprecated" parameters
to qmake.

Example: a static library in release mode, without deprecated functionality:
qmake -confit static -config release -config no_deprecated
